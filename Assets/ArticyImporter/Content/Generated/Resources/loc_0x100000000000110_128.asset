  - "\u201CExcellent. You can hear me.\u201D"
  - "\u201CFirst, you\u2019ll find the revolver. Otherwise the link\u2026\u201D"
  - Nothing happens.
  - Nothing ever happened.
  - And nothing ever will.
  - "Choice doesn\u2019t matter, since it doesn\u2019t exist."
  - But you already know that.
  - "Only\u2026"
  - Who are you?
  - "I\u2026 I don\u2019t remember."
  - Who ARE you?
  - "Where am I? What\u2019s happening?"
  - "It\u2019s rude to answer a question with a question, you know. Besides, you\u2019re
    not really interested. And it\u2019s better not to think about it anyway. But\u2026"
  - "No wonder you don\u2019t. But does that change who you are? Or not? Will you
    ever learn the answer to that question? Because\u2026"
  - "I know no more than you do, believe me. Or don\u2019t. It won\u2019t make any
    difference \u2014 I still can\u2019t give you any information, and will just
    stall for time until\u2026"
  - "Unfortunately, the sweet, sweet oblivion has already been stolen. You\u2019ll
    have to choose. But who will?"
  - Something unintelligible echoes in your head. Assuming you even have one.
  - "Before you appears the image of a woman whose name is branded into your mind.
    Your own name \u2014 still nothing."
  - "\u201C\u2026this anomaly stands out among the previous ones. And I don\u2019t
    like what that might mean.\u201D"
  - "Why don\u2019t I remember anything?"
  - "\u201CWhy don\u2019t I remember anything?\u201D you mouth soundlessly. The only
    question that matters now. After all, you *should* remember."
  - "\u201CAnd that shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 Never mind. Find the revolver, then
    I\u2019ll be able to explain more.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIf the oddities are involved\u2026 No, that\u2019s too much, but if\u2026\u201D
    A sharp sound pierces your eardrums. No pain. None? \u201CTrust no one, they\u2019re
    changing\u2026\u201D"
  - "You can\u2019t make out anything else. Undoubtedly, it was very important. Now
    you can either succumb to paranoia, or let the misunderstood words slip past
    and die a horrible death, bring about the end of the world, and cruelly betray
    ideals you no longer remember."
  - "It\u2019s time to open your eyes."
  - The possibilities are dazzling.
  - "And unfortunately\u2026"
  - "I don\u2019t understand anything. What\u2019s going on?"
  - "\u201CI don\u2019t understand anything. What\u2019s going on?\u201D you mouth
    soundlessly.\r\n\r\nBut were those words even meant for you? Now that\u2019s
    a good question."
  - "You approach a suspicious-looking man. It\u2019s unclear whether he noticed
    you. Rummaging through the produce seems to occupy him more."
  - "You\u2019re going to kill Ratko. Granted, he\u2019s annoying... but what\u2019s
    the point, really? Out of curiosity? For the sake of satisfaction?"
  - You black out.
  - "\u201CWill you help me get a revolver out of impound?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m ready. What do we do?\u201D"
  - "Still... you don\u2019t want to waste time on him."
  - "You can\u2019t be the one to start the conversation. Too pushy. Making random
    noises, now that\u2019s a champion\u2019s strategy."
  - "\u201CLose something?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m willing to help you in exchange for information.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWell, I knew you\u2019d be back.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019ll help you \u2018borrow\u2019 that
    thing.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYour refusal hurt me a lot. I don\u2019t know how my pride will recover
    from a blow like that.\u201D"
  - "\u201CExcuse me?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage.\u201D"
  - "\u201CMy kind heart will be the death of me... Fine, here\u2019s the artifact
    description, now off you go to greatness.\u201D"
  - He shoves a note into your hand without even looking.
  - "\u201CI have a question for you.\u201D"
  - "\u201CGo ahead, ask.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHow did I end up here?\u201D"
  - "\u201CBy any chance, do you know how I could get a revolver out of storage?\u201D"
