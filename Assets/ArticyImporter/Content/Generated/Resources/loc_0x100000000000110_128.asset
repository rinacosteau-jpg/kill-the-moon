  - '"Excellent. You can hear me."'
  - "\"First, you\u2019ll find the revolver. Otherwise the link\u2026\""
  - Nothing happens.
  - Nothing ever happened.
  - And nothing ever will.
  - "Choice doesn\u2019t matter, since it doesn\u2019t exist."
  - But you already know that.
  - "Only\u2026"
  - Who are you?
  - "I\u2026 I don\u2019t remember."
  - Who ARE you?
  - "Where am I? What\u2019s happening?"
  - "It\u2019s rude to answer a question with a question, you know. Besides, you\u2019re
    not really interested. And it\u2019s better not to think about it anyway. But\u2026"
  - "No wonder you don\u2019t. But does that change who you are? Or not? Will you
    ever learn the answer to that question? Because\u2026"
  - "I know no more than you do, believe me. Or don\u2019t. It won\u2019t make any
    difference \u2014 I still can\u2019t give you any information, and will just
    stall for time until\u2026"
  - "Unfortunately, the sweet, sweet oblivion has already been stolen. You\u2019ll
    have to choose. But who will?"
  - Something unintelligible echoes in your head. Assuming you even have one.
  - "Before you appears the image of a woman whose name is branded into your mind.
    Your own name \u2014 still nothing."
  - "\"\u2026this anomaly stands out among the previous ones. And I don\u2019t like
    what that might mean.\""
  - "Why don\u2019t I remember anything?"
  - "\u201CWhy don\u2019t I remember anything?\u201D you mouth soundlessly. The only
    question that matters now. After all, you *should* remember."
  - "\"And that shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 Never mind. Find the revolver, then I\u2019ll
    be able to explain more.\""
  - "\"If the oddities are involved\u2026 No, that\u2019s too much, but if\u2026\u201D
    A sharp sound pierces your eardrums. No pain. None? \u201CTrust no one, they\u2019re
    changing\u2026\""
  - "You can\u2019t make out anything else. Undoubtedly, it was very important. Now
    you can either succumb to paranoia, or let the misunderstood words slip past
    and die a horrible death, bring about the end of the world, and cruelly betray
    ideals you no longer remember."
  - "It\u2019s time to open your eyes."
  - The possibilities are dazzling.
  - "And unfortunately\u2026"
  - "I don\u2019t understand anything. What\u2019s going on?"
  - "\u201CI don\u2019t understand anything. What\u2019s going on?\u201D you mouth
    soundlessly.\r\n\r\nBut were those words even meant for you? Now that\u2019s
    a good question."
  - "You approach a suspicious-looking man. It\u2019s unclear whether he noticed
    you. Rummaging through the produce seems to occupy him more."
  - Shoot Ratko with the revolver
  - "You\u2019re going to kill Ratko. Granted, he\u2019s annoying... but what\u2019s
    the point, really? Out of curiosity? For the sake of satisfaction?"
  - /we were getting along just fine/
  - You black out.
  - '"Will you help me get a revolver out of impound?"'
  - '"Will you help me get a revolver out of impound?"'
  - "\"I\u2019m ready. What do we do?\""
  - "\"I\u2019m ready. What do we do?\""
  - Leave.
  - "Still... you don\u2019t want to waste time on him."
  - Take a deep breath
  - "You can\u2019t be the one to start the conversation. Too pushy. Making random
    noises, now that\u2019s a champion\u2019s strategy."
  - '"Lose something?"'
  - '"Lose something?"'
  - "\"I\u2019m willing to help you in exchange for information.\""
  - "\"I\u2019m willing to help you in exchange for information.\""
  - "\"Well, I knew you\u2019d be back.\""
  - "\"I\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019ll help you \u2018borrow\u2019 that thing.\""
  - "\"I\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019ll help you \u2018borrow\u2019 that thing.\""
  - "\"Your refusal hurt me a lot. I don\u2019t know how my pride will recover from
    a blow like that.\""
  - '"Excuse me?"'
  - '"Excuse me?"'
  - "\"I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage.\""
  - "\"I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage.\""
  - "\"My kind heart will be the death of me... Fine, here\u2019s the artifact description,
    now off you go to greatness.\""
  - He shoves a note into your hand without even looking.
  - '"I have a question for you."'
  - '"I have a question for you."'
  - '"Go ahead, ask."'
  - '"How did I end up here?"'
  - '"How did I end up here?"'
  - '"By any chance, do you know how I could get a revolver out of storage?"'
  - '"By any chance, do you know how I could get a revolver out of storage?"'
  - '"They say you had some sort of nervous breakdown? Or something like that..."'
  - '"I see. So you know nothing."'
  - '"I see. So you know nothing."'
  - '"More than nothing! Something."'
  - '"Anyway, come to me if something interesting comes up. No point flapping your
    tongue for nothing."'
  - '"Care to elaborate?"'
  - '"Care to elaborate?"'
  - '"Apparently a serious nervous breakdown, since I had to be isolated."'
  - '"Apparently a serious nervous breakdown, since I had to be isolated."

    

    No
    kidding! You don''t say.'
  - '"But look at it from another angle! I didn''t start making up an epic story
    and convincing you it''s true. But I could have."'
  - He thoughtfully rubs his forehead.
  - '"It seems the local atmosphere of immeasurable boredom has gotten to me as well."'
  - '"...Thanks, and that''s it."'
  - '"...Thanks, and that''s it."'
  - '"You''re no help at all."'
  - '"You''re no help at all."'
  - '"Yeah, that''s how it is... That''s where the details I know end."'
  - '"All right, to your places!"'
  - '"We have nothing to talk about," the woman says sharply as soon as you''re two
    steps from her.

    

    Then she takes a sip of tea, silently puts the cup
    back on the table and returns to stirring.'
  - Leave
  - There's something... unsettling about this woman. You decide not to bother her
    without reason and leave.
  - "You approach a woman in red whose eyes are covered with a band for some reason.
    She slowly stirs the liquid in her cup with a spoon. It seems she's been at it
    for a long time\u2014there's no steam visible above the cup."
  - '"I''d like to ask you a question."'
  - 'You swallow nervously before asking. What is so frightening about this woman?

    

    "I
    would like to ask you a question..."

    

    You barely hear your own words.
    You''re not even sure they were spoken.'
  - 'It seems Runako didn''t hear you. She hasn''t torn herself away from her tea
    for a second.

    

    Either you need to say something weightier to get
    her attention.'
  - You approach Tasia.
  - '"Hmm? Do you need something?"'
  - '"Thanks for helping me get out. Could you answer a couple of questions?"'
  - '"Thanks for helping me get out. Could you answer a couple of questions?"'
  - '"No, I''d better go."'
  - '"No, I''d better go."

    

    The conversation didn''t take off. And Tasia,
    it seems, has already lost interest in you.'
  - '"I don''t know anything. The Monetarians know everything. Usually. That''s what
    they say. Try to find one of them."'
  - '"Monetarians?"'
  - '"Monetarians?"'
  - '"...All right. I''ll try."'
  - '"...All right. I''ll try."'
  - '"Good luck!"'
  - '"Uh-huh. The Monetarians."'
  - You're unlikely to get anything out of her.
  - '"You''re welcome."

    

    She blinks several times and looks at the chips,
    then at you.'
  - '"How much time has passed since I ended up in the med bay?"'
  - '"How much time has passed since I ended up in the med bay?"'
  - 'She looks at her guest card.

    

    "Half an hour?"'
  - '"An hour? About that. Probably."'
  - '"But... why does the clock say 12?"'
  - '"But... why does the clock say 12?"

    

    You''re asking the wrong questions.'
  - '"Because... lunch?"'
  - Can't argue with that.
  - '"So I haven''t been here a day?"'
  - '"So I haven''t been here a day?"

    

    You can say that again!'
  - '"Right, thanks. I''ll just... go."'
  - '"Right, thanks. I''ll just... go."'
  - 'Tasia raises a finger to the ceiling and says meaningfully: "I think the main
    question is not how long you''ve been here, but why."'
  - Philosophy has started. Time to bail.
  - You nervously tap your foot on the floor, waiting for the right moment. Can you
    go now?
  - Remove the grate and finally get out. And do it quietly.
  - So many obstacles in one ventilation shaft... What's it going to be like when
    you actually reach the vault...
  - You silently take off the grate and crawl out. Wow! There's even slightly less
    dust in the air.
  - You'd think it wouldn't be that hard to lift a grate. But you manage to blow
    it even here. The grate scrapes across the floor with the same sound as a corpse
    moving a tombstone. Probably.
  - Try your luck with lockpicks.
  - Let's test your safecracking skills gained in ten minutes!
  - You realize it's not going to work. Shame. There's still a chance to change your
    mind.
  - '"Okay, I think I''m starting to understand."'
  - '"GUARDS!"'
  - '"Miss, don''t waste my time. If someone had checked in a dog, I''d remember.
    You''ll be released soon and you can look for Sonya, Glasha and Alphyra."'
  - '"Okay, you know what, I think I''m starting to get it..."

    

    He glances
    around, but Ratko has already vanished without a trace. Just in time.'
  - '"You''re wasting my break time for nothing! Get out."'
  - "\"There's a library behind you. Try turning to the books. The authors of some
    of them might be even less biased than me\u2014a hungry man who's being kept
    from eating.\""
  - '"Start with that, then. Learn to read. In our time you can''t go anywhere without
    literacy."'
  - '"Are you going to create a union of professional... neutral ball guests?"'
  - '"What does your union say about lunch breaks? Because that''s exactly what this
    is. And I have a legal right to it, which my ancestors fought for. And you''re
    trying to take it away, so you''re more of an enemy to the common man."'
  - Don't make noise.
  - Now you're using the great wisdom Ratko imparted to you. Strain every brain cell,
    all three of them. Concentrate.
  - Well. Let's hope Theodore doesn't notice the racket you're making. Maybe it's
    not all lost yet?
  - You move almost silently, except for the rustle of fabric against metal.
  - What's the chance it's a mouse? And what would you prefer instead?
  - A cat?
  - A giant winged one? Yeah, that would be nice. Though it wouldn't fit here.
  - Cheese?
  - If you find any here, it'll definitely be moldy.
  - You'd better not touch the brightness of the card-flashlight if you don't want
    to go blind.
  - If they bite out my eyes, the chance of going blind is even greater.
  - All right then. Turn the light up full.
  - I'll be careful.
  - 'Uh-huh, uh-huh, sure.

    

    All right then. Turn the light up all the
    way.'
  - You make a random gesture with your fingers. And now you can make out THIS...
  - Needless to say, THIS is not a rat...
  - IT HAS THREE ROWS OF TEETH
  - BURN IT BURN IT CRUSH IT KILL
  - Maybe... I just don't remember what rats look like... maybe...
  - No. No, that is absolutely NOT a rat.
  - 'And it''s coming closer. A dark blue-black six-legged, shaggy something slowly
    scrabbles its clawed limbs over the metal. It opens its toothy maw wide.

    

    And
    it seems to be wheezing.'
  - You'll start wheezing too if you spend even another five minutes in this dust.
  - In any case, you interest the creature no more than the emptiness that surrounds
    it.
  - The non-rat moves forward and nothing will save you now. But you freeze in place.
    Don't forget to breathe. Oh. There's nothing to breathe.
  - There's not enough air! You're about to die.
  - It's getting closer.
  - Don't move.
  - Everything will resolve itself. Right? And if you die, after the loop resets
    you'll be fine. Or you'll end up as bloody shreds of flesh on the bed. Think
    positive.
  - Take a deep breath and run away.
  - You fill your lungs with dust and are about to double over in a coughing fit,
    but there's nowhere for you to bend.
  - The creature is a couple of dozen centimeters from your face. You don't move,
    you don't breathe, there's a lump in your throat.
  - '"Run away" is a strong word, since you simply shut your eyes (definitely safer
    that way) and back up.'
  - "It. Right. In front of your face. You're in its way. It brushes you with its
    disgusting fetid fur. At least you think it must be fetid\u2014you're not breathing."
  - It seems only a moment passed, but here you are again on the familiar floor of
    the med bay.
  - You fling your eyes open (yes, they'd been closed this whole time), shove the
    grate back into place as if you want to hammer it into the wall, and lightning-fast
    screw the bolts back in.
  - Think that'll stop it from getting to you? Optimistic.
  - You failed the mission. Congratulations. At least you stayed in one piece.
  - You clench your teeth and wait for the toothy creature to squeeze past you, trying
    not to think about the billion diseases you've contracted just by touching it.
  - This is too much. This is already too much. Sorry, but...
  - Breathe. Endure.
  - It seems like an eternity passes before you make yourself believe that the non-rat
    has already left.
  - You scream at the top of your lungs (which, when you think about it, aren't that
    powerful, so it comes out as a strangled wheeze).
  - "You survived that. Now\u2014the final push."
  - Return.
  - Are you for real right now?
  - As you wish. You return to the med bay. Mission failed.
  - '"What the devil is making such a racket here?"'
  - Leave the grate alone and get back before it's too late.
  - Mission failed!
  - Right now you need to be three times as careful as you were before. And no jokes
    about multiplying by zero...
  - This will be fun.
  - You've made too many mistakes. Time to return in defeat.
  - But you probably won't have time for another box, given how long you fiddled
    with this one. Time to return in triumph. Not for Ratko, of course, but what's
    the difference? His stuff would have disappeared after the reset anyway... Oh
    wait, are you planning to break the loop with a revolver? We'll see.
  - The lock isn't that complicated, but you're no pro either.
  - Yes, that's an opened box. Yes, there's a revolver in it. Ugh, a revolver. But
    you picked the lock! Try to contain your excitement, okay? You've still got to
    crawl back.
  - You try every possible angle, twist the pick this way and that, but the lock
    refuses to budge. Seconds pass, minutes pass. And finally...
  - '"Click!"'
  - "Oh. Oh. Oh. I know. You could try something... \r\n\r\nNo, that's a bad idea."
  - Try what?
  - Muffle the sound of the keys. Muffle the sound of your steps. You probably won't
    manage it, but...
  - Steal the keys from Theodore.
  - Well, at least they're not around his neck.
  - How?
  - Magic. Sonus. Sound magic. You remember something, right?
  - NO WAY. I'll just steal the keys. None of that other stuff.
  - Yes, that'll be better.
  - And that's why I'm sure nothing will work.
  - Most likely. But what if...
  - At least try it with the keys?
  - Fine, whatever. Why not?
  - If you fail you'll wake up in the med bay again. Maybe without your memory again.
    Incredibly low stakes.
  - You slowly move your feet across the cracked, indeterminate-colored tile.
  - So far everything is going fine. You end up next to Theodore.
  - Forget bad ideas, you just need to take the keys off his belt.
  - And do it quietly. And by the book.
  - You are determined not to make a sound and finally get those keys. This has gone
    on far too long...
  - What a pity that intentions so often don't match results! Does that surprise
    you?
  - You silently take the keys and return to the boxes.
  - Congratulations, you did it. Time to go back.
  - There's not much left. Why not wait? There's nothing else to do anyway.
  - There's nothing to do here for now.
  - By the way, you hate waiting. Just for the record.
  - But now you can think about all your failures.
  - Considering how quickly you accumulate them, memory loss is the best thing that
    could have happened to you.
  - Soon you'll start dreaming for it to happen again...
  - Look, it's already 13:00 on the clock! And that means lunch is... what?
  - There is always another attempt.
  - You're not listening to him anymore, because now you have something more important.
  - You notice a strange light coming from your pocket.
  - This is you.
  - Most likely it's you.
  - Well, that's settled. By the way...
  - Figure out how to adjust the card's brightness.
  - You make various gestures trying to determine what the card responds to.
  - 'It''s got all of this depicted on it. A familiar scene, right? No?

    

    That''s
    okay, they''ll clue you in in a moment.'
  - Play around with the card.
  - You keep turning the card in your hands and poking everywhere you can. You're
    not in a potentially deadly situation, after all. In a locked room. In the *DARK*.
    Knowing nothing about yourself except what's described in your little toy.
  - You stick your hand into your pocket (how rash) and pull out a kind of translucent
    rectangle. And on it...
  - 'Yep. It''s you. See your own hair? Pink, right. Do you think many people walk
    around with that? Ah, you don''t remember anything.

    

    In short, no,
    not many. And there''s a 99 out of 100 chance it''s you. Just take it as a fact
    and move on.'
  - Can I not be this?
  - Too late. See, you're already associating that creature with yourself.
  - All right
  - Wonderful.
  - "Left-right-up\u2014remember that gesture, because it just made the card flash
    across the whole room. Congratulations, now you see the door! And, it seems,
    curtained windows. Or are those minimalist paintings on the walls."
  - Use your new knowledge wisely...
  - The card emits a faint light and seems to respond to your movements. Perhaps
    you can use it to find a way out of the darkness.
  - Now you can make it out. Congratulations.
  - Try to open the door
  - So, how are we going to open it?
  - Toward yourself
  - You press the handle and pull the door toward you.
  - Away from yourself
  - You press the handle and push the door away from you.
  - Nothing happens. Well, try the opposite.
  - You try to open the door again, and... It's locked! Shocking, I know.
  - What now?
  - Step away from the door
  - Yes, there's nothing to catch here.
  - Ask the door to open
  - Yeah, very funny. You're not serious, are you?
  - Kick the door
  - As always, a brilliant solution! How are you kicking?
  - Gently
  - The door doesn't care.
  - Harder
  - "You draw your leg back and get ready to slam this door as hard as you can...
    But something\u2014maybe your last brain cell\u2014stops you at the last moment.
    The door seems to be made of iron or something tougher. Do you really want to
    do this? Think carefully."
  - Yes, I do
  - Well then, go ahead and kick. Common sense can't break you!
  - Actually, I'm not going to do that
  - You step away from the door. Either way, it doesn't care.
  - You draw your leg back and prepare to slam the door as hard as you can... Your
    boot thuds against the metal.
  - "At that moment pain seems to explode in your foot\u2014a sharp, slicing stab
    that travels up your leg to the thigh.\r\n\r\nFuneral bells ring in your ears.
    The barely discernible walls seem to drift away somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe door ripples;
    apparently it took quite a hit.\r\n\r\nYour knees buckle and the whole room collapses
    to a single black dot, with no one left to see it."
  - The card plays the color sequence so quickly that you feel like you're going
    to throw up.
  - Something clicked. You can try opening the door again.
  - There's nothing to be done here for now.
  - I have no idea what happened or why you're back here again. Try asking someone...
    For example, Tasia. Yes, definitely her.
  - At least now you know how the door opens, and you won't have to shout through
    the window.
  - This is definitely a door.
  - By the way, the clock reads 12:00 again.
  - Have you been here a whole day already?
  - Wait, but you saw Tasia through the grate. She's been here a whole day too? Isn't
    the timer supposed to have... Okay. You'll find out soon.
  - '"Why is everyone so sure that I..."

    

    Under your gaze Ratko sighs
    and rolls his eyes.

    

    "Fine, I did promise information after all..."'
  - '"This building has been rebuilt a thousand times. It went from yours to ours
    and back, all that. And the new owners really wanted, I don''t know, to remodel
    everything to suit themselves to show that they were on top? Something like that,
    yeah."'
  - '"And what if I tell the guard about your plan?"'
  - '"And what if I tell the guard about your plan?"'
  - '"Are you kidding? You just suggested that yourself.

    

    So you''ll
    be left without your favorite weapon, whatever you needed it for. I won''t end
    up in isolation again, so what''s the difference?"'
  - '"But I''m going to tell anyway."'
  - '"But I''m going to tell anyway."'
  - '"Go ahead."

    

    It seems he doesn''t particularly care about your words.'
  - '"Okay, I was joking. So, what''s the theft plan?"'
  - '"Okay, I was joking. So, what''s the theft plan?"'
  - Ratko irritably twirls his cigarette, weighing whether it's worth dealing with
    you after such antics, but still makes a positive decision. Maybe in vain.
  - '"Distract the old man with chatter while I swipe my stuff. Er, our stuff."'
  - '"What am I supposed to say?"'
  - '"What am I supposed to say?"'
  - Let's do the opposite.
  - '"Let''s do the opposite."

    

    And are you sure you''ll make a silent,
    sneaky ninja?'
  - '"Do you have no imagination at all? It doesn''t matter what you say, as long
    as the old codger isn''t looking my way! Like, ask how his grandchildren are
    doing, or complain that the Aspectarians will squeeze us all down to Earth."'
  - 'At your words Ratko grimaces.

    

    "If we go through... the count now,
    there''s no way he''ll fall for another performance like that. And I''m not exactly
    sure they''ll return to me... what they''re supposed to return when the timer
    ends."

    

    He doesn''t believe in you either. How about that.'
  - '"Fine, let''s do it your way. But what should I say to him?"'
  - '"Fine, let''s do it your way. But what should I tell him?"'
  - '"Actually, I stole the artifact."'
  - '"Actually, I stole the artifact."'
  - '"Borrowed," he says automatically.'
  - '"Just don''t forget about my revolver, that''s the main thing. Otherwise you
    won''t like the consequences."'
  - '"Just don''t forget about my revolver. Otherwise you won''t like the consequences."'
  - '"And right now it''s not theft either, but reappropriation."'
  - '"And right now this isn''t theft either, it''s repeated appropriation."'
  - '"Any time. Come back to me when you''re ready. But no later than 12:45, because
    then we probably won''t finish before the end of lunch. And once lunch is over,
    the old man will start fussing."'
  - Ratko frowns irritably. "Yeah, yeah, can't do without it. I've already realized
    you can bore people to death."
  - Ratko sighs tiredly. "All right. Just don't go thinking you're now a pro at reappropriation.
    We don't have much time for lessons, so I'll tell you what I can."
  - For ten minutes Ratko tries to hammer into your head how not to make noise in
    the ventilation, not to make noise when getting out of it, and how to quickly
    find what you need once you're there.
  - '"All right. When do we start?"'
  - '"All right. When do we start?"'
  - '"Yes. I''ll come back when I''m ready."'
  - '"Yes. I''ll come back when I''m ready."'
  - '*Describe your revolver.*'
  - You describe your revolver. For some reason reluctantly.
  - Uh... I don't remember.
  - '"Uh... I don''t remember."

    

    Why did you say that, why?! Do you get
    off on making yourself look like an idiot?'
  - '"Got it. On the spot I''ll try to make sure it''s the very revolver you don''t
    remember. No problem. Is that all now?"'
  - '"I''ll remember. Now is that all?"'
  - 'Ratko looked away and smirked. "Ah, right. Well, I could bring you everything
    I see; there probably isn''t an entire arsenal. Not many people here have permission
    for weapons, although sometimes it seems like every other person does."

    

    "So
    what does it look like?"'
  - Wait a minute. He didn't even ask what your revolver looks like. What if there
    are several of them?
  - '"But today you''re incredibly lucky, and the stars have aligned so that something
    was unjustly taken from me as well. And justice must be restored."'
  - '"Can you imagine how many walled-off rooms and blocked-off vents there are here...
    It''s like paradise, right?"'
  - As I understand it, one of the passages leads to the vault.
  - '"As I understand it, one of the passages leads to the vault."

    

    No,
    he just decided to talk to you about architecture.'
  - Listen silently.
  - '"Nope, I just decided to discuss history."'
  - "\"In short, a good friend of mine, whose brother\u2019s acquaintance took part
    in an inspection of the premises before this super-important event, told me about
    a couple of pretty good passages.\""
  - '"And, believe it or not, one of them leads from the med bay to the vault."'
  - '"So I can just go along it and take what I need?"'
  - '"So I can just go along it and take what I need?"

    

    You already know
    what the answer will be.'
  - '"But there is a problem..."'
  - '"But there is a problem..."'
  - '"Dreaming is harmless."'
  - '"Ancient and terrible. Theodor Kavish in person."'
  - '"Someone has to distract the old man. There are no other options here."'
  - '"Is this somehow related to what you''re trying to find in the tomatoes?"'
  - '"Is this somehow related to what you''re trying to find in the tomatoes?"'
  - '"And what is your plan?"'
  - '"And what is your plan?"

    

    Are you serious right now?'
  - Through the lenses of his colored glasses Ratko looks at you with a certain pity.
  - '"One of us distracts Theodor, the other grabs the stuff from the lockers."'
  - '"What''s that got to do with it?.. No."'
  - You'll never learn the secret of the tomatoes.
  - '"In short, the plan is as cheap in execution as the honor of Primoriya."'
  - '"And then there''s lockpicking..." He takes out his guest card to check the
    time.

    

    "No, I won''t have time. You''ll look for the keys there,
    and pray he doesn''t wear them around his neck."'
  - '"Nope. I won''t have time. Pray he doesn''t wear the keys around his neck."'
  - '"Nothing good will come of it, but at least I''ll have some fun."'
  - '"Explain how to pick locks."'
  - '"Explain how to pick locks."'
  - '"I already know a thing or two. So it''s better not to waste time."'
  - '"I already know a thing or two. So it''s better not to waste time."'
  - He looks at you doubtfully.
  - '"All right. It''s dead boring here anyway."'
  - '"If you want it that much... Fine, listen and remember."'
  - "And you see it. A transparent casket containing exactly what you're looking
    for: three small cubes with edges as thick as a little finger\u2014one black,
    one red, and one gold. Through the veins of their viscous, cloudy faces there
    seems to be a glow seeping out. The shape is perfect; you can't take your eyes
    off it. You don't want to. You realize: this is the very artifact Ratko was talking
    about.\r\n\r\nNow the main thing is to figure out how to get it. And, perhaps,
    keep it for yourself."
  - '"I''m so tired of these games. She wants the yokan so badly? Fine, let her take
    it. Let her take whatever pops into her head. But even then she won''t stop blaming
    me for her own choice. What am I even..."'
  - The woman doesn't let herself finish the phrase and her voice becomes emotionless
    again. "I'm sorry, it's none of your business. Take what you came for and leave
    me alone." The emotional outburst ended before it began. Pity. What about the
    show?
  - '"Uh, thanks."'
  - '"Uh, thanks."'
  - That's stupid. Surrender and walk away.
  - It's not worth it. It's unlikely someone like you could steal a powerful artifact.
    Better not even try.
  - '"Artifact?" There seemed to be a hint of interest in the woman''s voice. You
    could swear she raised an eyebrow under the bandage.'
  - '"So you''re talking about..." The woman runs her hand deliberately through her
    own hair. "Of course. That artifact. All clear."'
  - '"Yes, such a powerful artifact... It can slow down and speed up time. Do you
    have one?"'
  - '"Yes, such a powerful artifact... It can slow down and speed up time. Do you
    have one?"'
  - '"What is this, some new order from...?"'
  - You have no idea what she's talking about.
  - It seems she took your words as some kind of cipher. And it might also mean that
    you're the kind of person who could very well have passed coded messages in the
    past. You just don't remember it. And they won't tell you about it here.
  - These are perfect hexahedrons, in a divine quantity.
  - '"These are perfect hexahedrons, in a divine quantity." You say it less confidently.
    Something here is wrong after all.'
  - They were sweets for tea. You were asked to steal sweets.
  - You have the artifact. It's time to return to Ratko and demand a reward. Wait,
    did he promise a reward?
  - The interlocutor is silent.
  - Only silence sees you off.
  - '"Parting with him is hard, but inevitable."'
  - '"Parting with him is hard, but inevitable."'
  - '"The highest level of sensations for those who are worthy."'
  - '"The highest level of sensations for those who are worthy."'
  - The interlocutor is silent again. The silence grows more tense. Maybe it's better
    to turn off this path before it's too late?
  - Silence. Finally, the woman's lips curl into something like a smirk.
  - Steal the artifact.
  - You consider how you could more neatly 'borrow' the cubes.
  - 'Yes, you couldn''t rob the blind woman. But look at it another way: you''re
    still alive!

    

    Wait, what are the positives here...'
  - Your extraordinary intellect tells you that when you're robbing the blind, the
    main thing is not to make any noise. Will you manage it?
  - "You pick up the casket with the artifact inconspicuously, as if it hadn\u2019t
    even been on the table."
  - Delight! You managed to rob a blind woman. Add it to your short list of achievements.
  - '"What. Are. You. Doing."'
  - You were about to snatch the casket with the artifact when suddenly...
  - '"Me? I''m already leaving."'
  - '"Me? I''m already leaving."'
  - But all that comes to mind is to grab it and run.
  - '"I don''t want to steal from anyone."'
  - '"I don''t want to steal from anyone."'
  - "\"Why steal straight away! I'm telling you: bor-row. And how soon the client
    returns the borrowed item to the owner\u2014that's their business.\""
  - '"The client?"'
  - '"The client?"'
  - '"And that''s none of your business." He frowns, then checks himself and forces
    a polite smile. "I mean, that information won''t help you. The main thing is
    to bo... borrow the thing; forget the rest."'
  - '"Why don''t you do it yourself?"'
  - '"Why don''t you do it yourself?"'
  - '"It''s beneath my status to deal with that! There''s no one here from my...
    subordinates, and I myself have more important matters."'
  - I can handle this.
  - '"I can handle this."

    

    At handling forgetting everything? Ha-ha.'
  - '"Uh-huh. So, a petty little job not worthy of your attention."'
  - '"Uh-huh. So, a petty little job not worthy of your attention."'
  - '"Well, don''t get too relaxed. For me this job might be too easy, but you''re
    not a pro."'
  - '"In short, from a reliable source I know that the thing to be borrowed is a
    really cool magical artifact of the Reds... Maugfell people. So you won''t get
    out of the Rift, it will latch onto you... In short, this gizmo looks like semi-transparent
    cubes that give off a magical glow. You know. Precious."'
  - "\"Anyway, if you want to help\u2014it's all written here.\""
  - '"Let''s see what I can do."'
  - '"Let''s see what I can do."'
  - Ratko flinches as if he were caught doing something indecent and turns around.
  - He takes a drag on his cigarette and gives you a thoughtful look. "Maybe you
    can manage something... although..."
  - '"What exactly did I do? You see, after being detained by the Guards I have some...
    gaps in my memory."'
  - '"What exactly did I do? You see, after being detained by the Guards I have some...
    gaps in my memory."'
  - Be able to what?
  - '"Be able to what?"

    

    You can do something? Don''t make me laugh.'
  - Seeing you, he visibly relaxes. Your appearance can evoke only pity.
  - '"Ah, awake now, local celebrity?"'
  - Local celebrity?
  - '"Local celebrity?"

    

    No, that phrase definitely doesn''t bode well.
    You don''t really want to know the whole story, do you? You don''t, right?'
  - '"Do you know me?"'
  - '"Do you know me?"'
  - Remain silent out of embarrassment.
  - Oh, nothing good awaits you on that path, I assure you.
  - '"What, you''ll say it isn''t so? Your arrival in the Isolator today made quite
    a splash. And that''s even though we have two Players and two Sixes here. It
    would seem you''re a complete nobody. But such a talent!"'
  - '"Well, after such a performance it''s easier to ask who *doesn''t* know you.
    Your arrival in the Isolator today made quite a splash. And that''s with two
    Players and two Sixes here. It would seem you''re a complete nobody. But such
    talent!"'
  - '"Come on, don''t be modest. Your arrival in the Isolator today made quite a
    splash. And that''s even though we have two Players and two Sixes here. It would
    seem you''re a complete nobody. But such talent!"'
  - '"Ah, funny. I heard about that kind of side effect; they use time magic or something
    like that in their guns?

    

    Well, tough luck."'
  - He didn't answer your question. Maybe you don't need to know?
  - '"You didn''t answer my question."'
  - '"You didn''t answer my question."'
  - '"Unlucky."'
  - '"Unlucky."'
  - '"Hm? Well, information isn''t free, you know."'
  - '"I need a little help with a certain matter... And you seem to be the perfect
    person for it."'
  - '"I''ll ask someone else."'
  - '"I''ll ask someone else."'
  - I see. And what will the payment be?
  - '"I see. And what will the payment be?"

    

    Only the cheese in the mousetrap
    is free. And now a paid cheese in a mousetrap awaits you. Progress?'
  - '"But if you screw up, we can gracefully shift the blame onto your... reputation.
    You know. Your head isn''t quite clear yet. Besides, you''re also one of the
    Reds..."'
  - '"What will I get for helping?"'
  - '"What will I get for helping?"'
  - '"What''s the job?"'
  - '"What''s the job?"'
  - '"There''s something we need to borrow from that creepy woman. Maybe you know
    her. After all, she''s also from the Reds. I mean, from Maugfell."'
  - '"Runako, yeah. The one in a dress. Sits in the library."'
  - From the information you already have, this Runako is someone very, very dangerous
    and powerful. And just imagine what she'll do to you when you try to 'borrow'
    something from her.
  - Why not give it a try? You probably won't manage anything, of course. Maybe it's
    not worth it.
  - He pulls a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and unfolds it, trying in
    haste to smooth it out.
  - And yet I'm not going to steal.
  - '"And yet I''m not going to steal."

    

    What a moral compass! Such strong
    convictions! Everyone is impressed and applauds.'
  - '"Excellent! Just don''t take too long."

    

    He hands you the piece
    of paper and goes back to searching... whatever it is among the vegetables.'
  - '"Don''t hope too much; falling hurts. No one here knows more than I do... Or
    they won''t want to tell. We''ll talk again when you''re convinced of that."'
  - That's the only reason he's offering this to you. The chance to wriggle out by
    blaming your insanity if things go wrong.
  - '"I''m not really well-versed in those things, after all I''m normal... I mean,
    not a mage."'
  - 'He grimaces as if he expected you to sign up for any adventure for free, then
    sighs and flicks ash onto the floor.

    

    "Let''s put it this way...
    I''m a very useful person to have in your debt. I know many interesting... stories.
    Not such old stories. Interesting places. And all sorts of little things like
    that."'
  - Not interested.
  - '"Not interested."

    

    I''ll walk around and look some more.'
  - '"Alright, I''m listening"'
  - '"Alright, I''m listening"'
  - "\"Luck is a fickle thing. Unlucky today\u2014lucky tomorrow! By the way...\""
  - '"As you wish. But my gut tells me you''ll be back."'
  - '"Not steal. Borrow. Well, your cause is righteous, good luck and all that."

    

    He
    goes back to searching... whatever in the vegetables.'
  - Look around for the artifact.
  - You look around searching for the artifact.
  - I did your job for you.
  - '"I did your job for you." You show the artifact when Ratko turns around.'
  - 'He turns the casket in his hands and frowns.

    

    "Seems like it''s
    the right thing."'
  - '"Wait, this is..."

    

    He frowns.

    

    "So she entrusted this
    to you? Going around me?"'
  - He's actually impressed that you managed it.
  - '"Next time let Liberia sort out her own idiotic tasks. I was already close to
    making a plan. You could say I spent all my strength on it. And this is what
    happens?"'
  - '"In any case..."

    

    He puts the artifact in his belt pouch.'
  - '"I heard you have a powerful magical artifact..."'
  - '"I heard you have a powerful magical artifact..."'
  - It will be easier the second time. I hope.
  - Now you know that your failure isn't final. At the same time, failures are still
    failures.
  - So, how do we do this?
  - Steal the artifact
  - Ask about the artifact.
  - '"I heard you have a powerful magical artifact..."'
  - Leave.
  - Maybe next time... You probably won't endure another failure.
  - She didn't hear you. Or she heard you and ignored you. Then stealing something
    will be more difficult. Which means it's not even worth trying.
  - "Come on, force yourself to try. Nope, you can't. Faith is gone, the path is
    closed. Definitely not temporarily cut off in the demo\u2014wait, what?"
  - In short, you step away from Runako. Don't think about it.
  - '"It stings! But why are you reporting to me?"'
  - "\"If questions come up\u2014come by.\""
  - '"I was told that you know a lot of interesting things about this place and its
    guests. So in exchange for the artifact I want to get answers."'
  - '"I was told that you know a lot of interesting things about this place and its
    guests. So in exchange for the artifact I want to get answers."'
  - '"We''re in a time loop, and you''ve already given me this assignment; you just
    don''t remember. And you promised to answer a couple of my questions for it."'
  - '"You promised to answer a couple of my questions if I bring the artifact. But
    you don''t remember that, because we''re in a time loop."'
  - '"So instead of a reward for the artifact itself, you chose to get information
    from me. Strange, but all right."'
  - '"Uh-huh, very funny. She sent you to me with questions. Well, fine."'
  - '"Hmm? Do you need something?"'
  - Loud music is coming from outside.
  - She's not that far. Maybe you could poke her with something?
  - You look around and notice a mop. Convenient.
  - Shout over the music
  - You draw a deep breath and yell "Tasia" at the top of your lungs!
  - Focus on the sound wave.
  - 'You focus on individual notes, on sounds, on the entire flow of the music. In
    the sound you begin to sense something... kindred to yourself? Something that
    might respond to a call if you call correctly.

    

    Maybe you could...
    No, that''s silly. You won''t be able to. Try something else.'
  - Throw a chunk of paint that has peeled off the wall at her.
  - The flight of the first is stopped by the grate. The second falls to the floor.
    The third hits her shoulder but so weakly that the girl doesn't notice.
  - Wait until she looks your way on her own, then act
  - You brace your hands on the wall and start waiting, watching the play of light
    in the half-empty hall.
  - You look ridiculous. But it seems you've managed to get her attention.
  - Try to muffle the music.
  - You mentally "smooth" the wave. For a moment it seems like the sounds become
    quieter...
  - This is a terrible, TERRIBLE idea. Try something else.
  - It wouldn't have worked anyway. You know that perfectly well, so why try?
  - Seconds, minutes, months, years drift by lazily. You're seriously just WAITING
    in some unknown dark room with bars on the windows, instead of trying to do ANYTHING?
  - Time is passing, the clock is ticking, we're all going to die, you need to hurry.
    Think about that. Think about anything. At least move your brain instead of just
    standing there slowly dying.
  - Ha. Ha. Ha. Seriously? She's less than two meters from you.
  - Finally, you get lucky and another piece of paint hits her right in the forehead!
  - After an eternity of time wasted by you, Tasia suddenly glances around and then
    fixes her gaze on you. Or on your silhouette behind the bars. It doesn't surprise
    her at all; it's as if she found exactly what she was looking for. And that,
    in turn, surprises you.
  - No, did you really think that would work? Think again. You'll NEVER have the
    strength for that.
  - You carefully (don't poke her eye) move the mop handle toward Tasia. However,
    she notices your efforts before the wooden handle even touches her clothes.
  - The door is locked and I want to go out
  - '"The door is locked and I want to go out."'
  - '"Why have I been locked in here?"'
  - '"Why have I been locked in here?"'
  - '"Were they supposed to lock it?" Tasia looks somewhere past you for a few seconds,
    as if forgetting you exist.'
  - 'Finally, just as you''re about to use your superpower of attracting attention
    for a second time, she turns her gaze to you and says:

    

    "Wait here,
    I''ll go get the Guard."'
  - Continue waiting in the dark, for example. Quietly die without attracting attention.
    That would be simpler.
  - Try to get her attention
  - You tap on the grate and call her name several times, but she doesn't hear you.
  - '"Woke up? So you''re alive.

    

    Did you really have to tear me away
    from my work? That door opens with a guest card."'
  - Prod Tasia with the mop
  - The main thing is not to jab her full force. Don't poke out her eye. Don't drop
    the mop. Why are your hands shaking? Have they always shaken? Doesn't matter.
    Try it.
  - Go to her already!
  - It's not like you can leave from here. The main thing is that meeting the Guard
    doesn't make everything worse. On the other hand, what options did you have?
  - '"I don''t remember ANYTHING. Why don''t I remember anything?"'
  - '"Why don''t I remember anything?"

    

    Still waiting for someone to
    give you a hint? Do you think answers to your questions even exist?'
  - Sorry to bother you, I'll go.
  - '"Sorry to bother you, I''ll go."

    

    The door opens with the card,
    of course. You could have tried that before bothering other people. Just a tip
    for the future.'
  - "\"You won't get far. At least for now. The card shows how long you have left
    in the Isolator until the timer runs out\u2014you can't get out the main door.\""
  - '"Hmm. Tough luck."'
  - Give the Guard a meaningful look.
  - Looking at your beaten-dog expression, the Guard rolls her eyes.
  - I'm sorry?
  - '"I''m sorry?" you squeeze out.'
  - '"The magic used to neutralize particularly rowdy guests has a number of side
    effects. And partial memory loss is one of the rarest. Tough luck."'
  - Tough luck! But now you know you're a particularly rowdy guest who had to be
    neutralized. Super!
  - '"Sometimes people pay big money to forget things. Enjoy the ignorance while
    you can."'
  - '"You haven''t forgotten how to talk or walk. You''ll manage."'
  - "\"The memory-loss effect is temporary. Most likely, when it's time to leave
    the Isolator\u2014you'll remember everything.\""
  - '"But I have no time to chat and I''m no expert on magical anomalies. You''ll
    figure it out yourself from here."'
  - The Isolator..?
  - '"The Isolator..?"

    

    Yes, yes, quickly, ask at least something. Who
    knows, maybe the other inhabitants of this place (oh ho-ho, you''re in for ''rowdy
    guests'') are even less friendly than this nice lady.'
  - '"The Isolator is a room for temporary detainees. ''Detainees,'' however, isn''t
    quite the right word. There are no additional restrictions on you, except a temporary
    ban on leaving the Isolator."'
  - "\"The guest card indicates how long you have left to stay here until the timer
    runs out\u2014you can't get out through the main door.\""
  - What did I do to end up here?
  - '"For what..."'
  - '"So what am I supposed to do now?"'
  - '"So what am I supposed to do now?"'
  - '"But it''s not partial. I don''t remember anything at all. I even learned my
    own name from the card."'
  - '"But it''s not partial. I don''t remember anything at all. I even learned my
    own name from the card."'
  - And what's outside the Isolator?
  - '"And what..."'
  - '"I''m not obliged to answer those questions and I need to get back to my post."'
  - She's had enough of you. Go bother someone else.
  - The card in your hand changes its image.
  - Yes, it's that girl right in front of you. You have no idea what all the other
    words mean, but Tasia is definitely her name.
  - And only she can help you.
  - You walk up to the window.
  - Beyond the window grate you see a large brightly lit room filled with gaming
    tables. But you don't see any people in the room except for a single girl. She's
    very close, but she's not looking at you, she's carefully studying her chips.
  - WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON HERE???
  - '"What..."'
  - ...but after a split second everything snaps back and a sharp pain pierces your
    head.
  - Behind the curtain there's a grate wide enough for you to fit your hand through.
    You note that the grate is rusty, the paint on the walls is peeling and lying
    in chunks on the floor and windowsill, and cobwebs shimmer in the corners. In
    general, this place has seen better days, but that's not what should concern
    you now.
  - Better check the door first.
  - So, it seems it's worth discussing what's happening.
  - The voices in my head, for example.
  - The voices in my head, for example.
  - Everything is happening again.
  - "The clock shows 12 again. Everything is happening again, or your clock is broken
    and you have an overly long d\xE9j\xE0 vu. Or everyone else suddenly lost their
    memory, just like you. Or they want you to think that, and they're just pretending."
  - That's called "thoughts," if you can imagine. Or are you talking about Akaimun?
    She wasn't here this time, by the way. She's not part of the loop. As for the
    rest...
  - They want to drive me insane.
  - '"Drive you insane? How could it get any worse?

    

    Well, suppose this
    theory is true. Then you''ll still have to pretend you''re following their script."'
  - Time loops.
  - You understand time loops as a concept, yeah. Considering an hour ago you couldn't
    remember your own name.
  - And observe whether anything has changed in behavior or words. It's easy to start
    getting paranoid, so don't overdo it.
  - Remember the time when everything disappeared? 13:00.
  - If when it comes everything repeats again...
  - If when it comes everything repeats again, then it's officially a time loop.
    Or an attempt to drive you crazy.
  - The only option is to carry out Akaimun's order.
  - Find the revolver, yes. Well, make that your priority. There's nothing interesting
    about repeating events. Maybe the world is supposed to work like that and you
    just don't remember.
  - Although... now this is interesting. Maybe there's a reason for it.
  - 'By the way... Why doesn''t this surprise you? Do you care about anything at
    all?

    

    Interesting, but let''s save that question for later. And now...'
  - I must find the revolver.
  - Find the revolver, yes. Well, make that your priority. There's nothing interesting
    about repeating events. Maybe the world is supposed to work like that and you
    just don't remember.
  - No, are you kidding? You *don't need* a revolver. Do something worthwhile.
  - Like what?
  - Searching for answers, for example.
  - I have to find it.
  - '"*Have* to find it? Did you borrow it from someone? I don''t remember that."'
  - I... What do I need it for?
  - Exactly. It was better without it. I mean, it will be better.
  - But, to be completely honest...
  - You have no other leads.
  - So... yes. Look for the revolver. Talk to the guards.
  - And what was the point of this argument?
  - How should I know? Get to work.
  - That's what I'll do.
  - Yep. Completely normal conversation.
  - Now it's with you again. But in a few minutes it will be gone.
  - 'While you''re in a time loop, what''s the point of obtaining it? Or of your
    achievements?

    

    Even sandcastles have a longer lifespan.'
  - I need to get out of here.
  - How?
  - '"Exactly. How? She promised to explain everything when you got the revolver.
    And where are the explanations?"'
  - Maybe I don't want to.
  - And what are you going to do? Wait? Are you sure the next reset won't make you
    forget everything again?
  - Something's wrong.
  - I'll wait.
  - How long will you wait? Are you sure the next reset won't make you forget everything
    again?
  - Act on your own. Find out what's going on.
  - There's nothing else to do here anyway.
  - And you also have endless attempts at doing nothing! Isn't that fascinating?
  - I can't. And I don't see the point.
  - Not the answer expected. Well. That works too.
  - That's where your story ends. Whether you remember or forget doesn't matter.
    You are not. You never were. You never will be.
  - End of the demo.
  - Well then, now... Now it's only just beginning.
  - Enjoy? Or not. Honestly, I couldn't care less.
  - You approach Liberia. She glances at you briefly, then looks away, returning
    to contemplating the void beyond the glass.
  - '"Can you answer a few questions?"'
  - '"Can you answer a few questions?"'
  - '"Only for this one. No."'
  - I'm not even going to dive into the weeds of these logical paradoxes.
  - Leave.
  - You have nothing to say for now. You leave.
  - '"Do you know anything about my revolver?"'
  - '"Do you know anything about my revolver?"

    

    Add also that you clearly
    remember having it.'
  - '"Uh, no, nothing."'
  - '"Uh, no, nothing."'
  - "You approach the door. Your path to freedom \u2014 or to a larger cage. Either
    way, two guards block the way."
  - '"I have an important question."'
  - '"I have an important question."'
  - "\"Timer\u2019s already up? I don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t come closer unless
    you want to spend the rest of your time unconscious.\""
  - Leave.
  - You have nothing to do here yet.
  - What if...
  - 'By the way, not a bad way to pass the time. Side effects: total memory loss.'
  - "Funny if that\u2019s why you remember nothing. You used that brilliant shortcut
    to oblivion too often."
  - Probably not, though. Something else is going on here...
  - "It probably can\u2019t get any worse. So?"
  - Approach
  - "You don\u2019t even have time to react \u2014 they knock you out instantly."
  - "I\u2019ll find something else to do."
  - "As you wish. But when you get bored \u2014 you know where to go."
  - '"You can at least remove the bullets! But I need it."

    

    Better without
    bullets than not at all.'
  - "\"Alright, and where is it? Can I at least make sure nothing\u2019s been done
    to it? It\u2019s really important to me.\""
  - "\"Alright, and where is it? Can I at least make sure nothing\u2019s been done
    to it? It\u2019s really important to me.\""
  - '"But I need it. For emotional support."'
  - '"But I need it. For emotional support."

    

    "Touching.'
  - '"A weapon for emotional support."'
  - '"That window over there."

    

    He points to the storage window.'
  - '"Your confiscated belongings will be returned after the timer expires."'
  - Uh-huh. Except the timer never expires.
  - '"For confiscated belongings, contact Theodor Kavish."

    

    He wants
    you to bother anyone but himself.'
  - "\"I\u2019d still like to know what\u2019s going on here.\"\r\n"
  - "\"I\u2019d still like to know what\u2019s going on here.\""
  - '"..."'
  - Better leave.
  - '"..."'
  - Well, it was worth a try. Or not.
  - '"No."'
  - '"I''m sure you can talk to someone who is currently NOT on duty."'
  - "And you just helped him with that artifact... Still, I wouldn\u2019t count on
    it."
  - "But first you need to do something for him in this loop. Otherwise there\u2019s
    no point in asking."
  - "They won\u2019t just hand you the revolver. Maybe Ratko can help? But I wouldn\u2019t
    count on it."
  - "They won\u2019t just hand you the revolver. Maybe someone here can help? Not
    many talkative people around\u2026"
  - "You approach Kotsuki. She is focused on a blank canvas. Do you have something
    to say? If not\u2014better go. I'm serious. Don\u2019t."
  - Leave
  - You leave. Not the time yet.
  - Nothing of interest here.
  - Leave
  - It is closed. Still.
  - "\u201CNope. Fifteen minutes left till the end of lunch \u2014 we won\u2019t
    make it in time. The chance is gone, good luck and all that.\u201D"
  - Time, time... where are you running to?
  - /off, reset/
  - /why the hell?/
  - Better to start early than be late.
  - Better to start early than be late.
  - '"I''ll wait a little."'
  - '"I''ll wait a little."'
  - You rap briefly on the window.
  - '"Lunch. Come back later."'
  - '"What''s for lunch? I''m hungry too."'
  - '"What''s for lunch? I''m hungry too."'
  - My little dog Sonya is missing!
  - '"My little dog Sonya is missing!" you blurt out without thinking. Maybe you
    should have thought first.'
  - '"I won''t be able to come later. We''re all in a time loop and the time resets
    right when lunch ends."'
  - '"I won''t be able to come later. We''re all in a time loop and the time resets
    right when lunch ends."'
  - '"Have you tried coming up with something original? I''ve heard that excuse twelve
    times just this month."'
  - '"But it''s true!"'
  - '"But it''s true!"'
  - '"Even if that''s true, it doesn''t change the fact that I''m on my legal break,
    miss. And now, if you''ll excuse me..."'
  - '"Do you have a complaints book? I want to complain."'
  - '"Do you have a complaints book? I want to complain."'
  - '"You can''t do this to me during such a political crisis! Ordinary people should
    unite, help each other, not shut themselves off... with glass walls!"'
  - '"You can''t do this to me during such a political crisis! Ordinary people should

  - '"Maybe there is. But it''s LUNCH now. During lunch the complaint book isn''t
    issued."'
  - '"Who came up with this idiotic rule?!"'
  - '"Who came up with this idiotic rule?!"'
  - '"Me. And now step away from the window and wait until lunch is over, or I''ll
    have to call the guard."'
  - '"Maybe we can come to some agreement?"'
  - '"Maybe we can come to some agreement?"'
  - '"Of course we can. How about this: you let me rest until the end of lunch."'
  - You move the cot aside, behind which, if Ratko is to be believed, there should
    be a vent.
  - '"You got him talking pretty well. Anyway, I managed to grab the things."'
  - '"There was only one revolver there, so that''s the one I took."'
  - '"But only mine." Ratko looks you straight in the eye, not a trace of regret
    on his face.'
  - '"There was no time."'
  - '"Well, anyway, we probably won''t be able to pull off the same thing a second
    time. The old man is already rustling around with his things..."'
  - Well, let's wait for the reset.
  - '"You''re worthless and I hate you."'
  - '"You''re worthless and I hate you."

    

    Say whatever you want, after
    all there are no consequences!'
  - Leave silently.
  - You leave without even bothering to listen to Ratko. And you won't even grace
    him with a contemptuous glance, will you? Fine.
  - Behind it you find a hastily screwed-on grate. It's clear that this passage has
    been used recently.
  - Remove the grate.
  - You unscrew the screws with your fingers and remove the grate.
  - Surrender and leave.
  - You won't succeed. You return in defeat.
  - In front of you is a narrow, cramped, dark passage. Good thing you have a flashlight.
    In case you're afraid of the dark.
  - Lie on the floor and crawl inside.
  - You squeeze into the passage.
  - The dust makes your nose itch and you barely restrain yourself from sneezing.
  - 'The passage seems to be trying to crush you. Squeeze you.

    

    The light
    from your guest card doesn''t help much; it rather makes the setting surreal
    and sinister.

    

    Move carefully, because the clatter of the vent will
    echo throughout the entire building.'
  - You already see the light ahead. (No, that's not your death yet. By the way,
    don't forget to start breathing.)
  - "Now you need to remove the second grate, only this time you won't have to unscrew
    it\u2014it's just leaning against the opening."
  - Fortunately, Theodore is too wrapped up in conversation with your buddy to notice.
  - The boxes have name tags of guests and keyholes. You know what to do. Probably.
  - With great difficulty you take off the grate and crawl out.
  - Look for the keys.
  - "If they were hanging somewhere on the wall\u2014it would be too easy."
  - Give up and go back.
  - You were so close... Okay, what am I saying. Mission failed!
  - Which is exactly why they're hanging on Theodore's belt!
  - You weigh your options.
  - '"So, how did it go?"'
  - You return to the agreed meeting place to discuss the results.
  - '"There was even time for your junk."'
  - '"There was even time for your junk."

    

    You hand him back his things.'
  - '"I only had time to grab my own things."'
  - '"I only had time to grab my own things."'
  - '"No way. I couldn''t steal anything."'
  - '"No way. I couldn''t steal anything."'
  - '"If I say I''m surprised, I''d be lying, and lying harms the truth, as the Founders
    used to say."'
  - '"If I say I''m surprised, I''d be lying, and lying harms the Truth, as the Founders
    said. Maybe not, who knows."'
  - First, of course, you'll deal with your own box. That revolver is vital to you.
    Even though you hate it. Hate? That's too strong a word. You don't really like
    thinking about it, but not having it nearby somehow feels... wrong.
  - '"What dog? There are no animals here. Unless you count that creepy giant winged
    cat." He says the last sentence so quietly you barely hear it. And you probably
    heard it wrong. Let''s assume you heard it wrong, otherwise you''ll completely
    lose your mind.'
  - '"That''s why she''s gone. My favorite dog Sonya..."'
  - '"That''s why she''s gone. My favorite dog Sonya..."'
  - '"I''d decide you''re trying to distract me, and not very skillfully at that.
    But I believe in the good in people."'
  - The clerk glances around and spots Ratko, who has almost disappeared into the
    vent. To be precise, he spots half of him. The better half...
  - Leave.
  - You head back to the meeting place with Ratko.
  - '"I... forgot how to read."'
  - '"I... forgot how to read."'
  - '"Yes, exactly. Want to join my union?"'
  - '"Yes, exactly. Want to join my union?"'
  - Guess three times what happens next.
  - Nope, you don't hate him. Do you even feel anything at all?
  - Fatigue.
  - Oh right. Fatigue and irritation. Nothing new. Boredom. And boredom, do you feel
    that too?
  - Irritation.
  - Oh right. Fatigue and irritation. Nothing new. Boredom. And boredom, do you feel
    that too?
  - He says something in response, surely something very witty. Or something totally
    indifferent.
  - No wonder this happened. Well, there's another option.
  - Or maybe forget it...
  - 'Seriously? Fine.

    

    I give up.'
  - It seems you're not the only source of sound here, because you hear rustling
    ahead.
  - So, the boxes are in front of you. And you have very little time, so first you
    open your own. You'll deal with the rest later.
  - The box could contain something to help clarify your memories. But there's nothing
    here except a revolver. For some reason, the sight of it irritates you.
  - It looks like you have time to take Ratko's things.
  - Ratko
  - 'In the box you find a sack sewn from colorful scraps, tied in a tight knot.

    

    You
    take that too. What''s the point, if after the reset his things will be back
    there again?'
  - Better not take risks and just go back.
  - Also true.
  - Doesn't matter. Time to go back.
  - 'And you see a sign: "Lunch until 13:00"'
  - You approach the storage window.
  - '"Well, now I owe you and all that..."'
